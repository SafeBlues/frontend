      Safe Blues: A Method for Estimation and Control in the Fight Against
      COVID-19
    </h1>
    <p>
      How do fine modifications to social distancing measures really affect
      COVID-19 spread? At the moment, we don't know! In an imaginary world, we
      would develop a harmless biological virus that spreads just like COVID-19
      but is traceable via cheap and reliable diagnosis. Then by spreading such
      an imaginary virus throughout the population, the spread of COVID-19 could
      be estimated because the benign virus would respond to population
      behaviour and social distancing measures in a similar manner to COVID-19.
      However, such a benign biological virus does not exist. Instead, we
      developed a safe and privacy-preserving digital alternative. We call this
      framework Safe Blues.
